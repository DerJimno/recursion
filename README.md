Project: Recursion from theodinproject.com.

# Assignment 1 (Method that returns an array of Fabonacci sequence RECURSIVELY!!!!)

It was kinda weird to get the fabonacci of a number recursively and
at the same time do another call of the method to get the next 
one (recursively) untill we have the array, that seemed to be wrong,
like an infinite loop, I can't see how one can manage to get it that way...
Instead I just got fabonaccis progressively with the help of recursion in fewer lines!

# Assignment 2 (Method to sort an Array using recursion)

Ooof this one wasn't that simple!
