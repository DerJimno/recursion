# Assignment 1 (Method that returns an array of Fabonacci sequence till a number given RECURSIVELY!!!!)

It was kinda weird to get the fabonacci of a number recursively and
at the same time do another call of the method to get the next 
one (recursively) untill we have the array, that seemed to be wrong,
like an infinite loop, I can't see how one can manage to get it that way...
Instead I just used the brute-force way to have the fabonaccis progressively
with the help of recursion in few lines!
